# Charles N Wyble Consultant Information Sheet

## Introduction

Hello,

Thank you very much for reaching out to me on this platform in regards to doing some consulting work for you !

I have been receiving a high number of inquiries and have developed a standardized response letter to help ensure
alignment and save everyone time and to reduce back and forth emails/texts/calls in the early stages.

If you have any :

- questions
- comments
- concerns

not covered by this document, please let me know and I'm happy to address them!

If you ask me something already covered in this reply, I will not respond to you and will not move forward with the engagement, so please read it carefully!

## Re: share my ID over email

I am a US Citizen (by birth).

I am happy to get on a teams/zoom/google meet etc call and show my ID.

I WILL NOT share my (full or redacted) photo ID over email or any other electronic written   communication. If that is a "requirement" then I have no interest in moving forward with this engagement and no further communication is necessary.

## Re: professional references

I am happy to provide project/professional references once an engagement letter has been signed. The engagement letter has a contingency clause allowing the client to back out if the reference review doesn't meet their requirements.

I will NOT provide project/professional references up front. If that is a "requirement" then I have no interest in moving forward with this engagement and no further communication is necessary.

## Re: on-site work/travel/expenses/relocation

if the role is not able to be performed remotely and is not based in ****  I will need to re-locate.

| Am I willing to re-locate at own expense? | No     |

Please be aware that:
